# Integrated Project: Moulding Data into Visual Stories in Maji Ndogo (Part 2)

## Project Overview

This is the second part of an integrated data analytics project focusing on transforming raw data into compelling visual narratives for Maji Ndogo. This phase emphasizes building robust data models, establishing proper relationships between datasets, and creating refined visualizations that tell clear, actionable stories.

## Project Objectives

- Import and clean multiple data tables independently
- Design and implement a working relational data model in PowerBI
- Establish proper relationships between different data entities
- Recreate and enhance existing visualizations using the new data model
- Refine visual elements including text, colors, and fonts for clarity and simplicity
- Analyze the impact of improved data modeling on visualization effectiveness

## Tools & Technologies

- **PowerBI**: Primary tool for data modeling and visualization
- **Data Sources**: Multiple tables containing Maji Ndogo operational data
- **Data Modeling**: Relational database principles applied in PowerBI
