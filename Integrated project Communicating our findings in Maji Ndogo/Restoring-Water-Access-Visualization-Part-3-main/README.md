# Integrated Project: Communicating Our Findings in Maji Ndogo (Part 3)

## Project Overview

This is the third part of the integrated Maji Ndogo project, focused on finalizing our national survey report through comprehensive data visualization and dashboard creation. This project synthesizes findings from the national water infrastructure survey and presents actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Project Description

In this concluding phase, we leverage advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions to create sophisticated measures and calculated columns that enrich our dataset. The project culminates in a comprehensive survey report that communicates our findings effectively through data visualization and storytelling.

## Objectives

- **Finalize Survey Report**: Complete the national survey analysis with refined data insights
- **DAX Implementation**: Create advanced measures and calculated columns for accurate data representation
- **Dashboard Development**: Build an interactive dashboard that effectively communicates survey findings
- **Data Enrichment**: Enhance raw data with meaningful calculations and derived metrics
- **Knowledge Integration**: Apply all concepts learned throughout the module in a cohesive final deliverable

## Key Components

### 1. Data Analysis & Enrichment
- Implementation of DAX measures for key performance indicators
- Creation of calculated columns for enhanced data representation
- Data validation and quality assurance processes

### 2. Dashboard Development
- Interactive visualizations displaying survey results
- User-friendly interface for stakeholder engagement
- Multi-dimensional analysis capabilities

### 3. Report Finalization
- Comprehensive survey findings documentation
- Executive summary with key insights
- Actionable recommendations based on data analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** or similar BI platform for dashboard creation
- **DAX** for advanced calculations and measures
- **Data visualization tools** for chart and graph creation
- **Presentation software** for slide deck preparation

### Skills Applied
